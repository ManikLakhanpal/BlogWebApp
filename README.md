# BlogWebApp 🌐
A simple blog site created by Manik Lakhanpal, currently a work in progress! ✨
You can access the live version on [blogs.w16manik.ninja](https://blogs.w16manik.ninja) 🚀

## Getting Started 🎯
These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine. 💻

### Prerequisites 📋
Before you begin, make sure you have Deno, Node, and npm installed on your machine. ⚙️

#### Installing Deno 🦕
If you don't have Deno installed, follow these steps:

1. **Download Deno:** 📥
   - Visit the official [Deno](https://deno.com/) website
   - Download the recommended version for your operating system

2. **Run the Installer:** 🔧
   - Follow the installation wizard instructions
   - You can use the default settings in most cases

3. **Verify Installation:** ✅
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Type the following command to check the installed Deno version:
     ```bash
     deno -v
     ```
   - You should see version numbers for Deno 2.x.x

### Installing Project Dependencies 📦
To install the project dependencies, run the following command in your **frontend** directory:
```bash
npm install
```
This command installs all the required packages listed in the package.json file.

### Launching the Site 🚀
You can launch the site using the following commands:

- In **backend** directory use:
   ```bash
   deno run main.ts
   ```
- In **frontend** directory use:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
  ```
These commands will start the application on port `localhost:3000`. 🌟

The first command starts the API server. Now, you can access the site in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` 🌐
